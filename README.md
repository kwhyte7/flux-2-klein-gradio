# What is this?
Simple script generated by gemini so I could have a gradio interface for flux-2-klein made by Black Forest Labs at https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux2
At the time, there was no script for gradio, and setting the environments didn't work for me.

# How did you make it work?
So I went to 
https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-base-4B
to download their model

The commands on huggingface to follow are (at the time of writing)

```
# Make sure git-xet is installed (https://hf.co/docs/hub/git-xet)
brew install git-xet
git xet install

git clone https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-base-4B

# If you want to clone without large files - just their pointers

GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-base-4B
```

Then I made a conda environment for Python 3.12 and CUDA 12.9

```
conda create -n flux2 python=3.12 cuda=12.9
conda activate flux2 # this activates conda
```

Put this script `mygradio.py` into the same folder as the FLUX.2-klein model.
Activate conda

run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
if you have the requirements file I provided.

# Run program

Activate conda, and `python3 mygradio.py` in the same directory or `python mygradio.py` if you are on windows.

otherwise if it doesn't work or requirements are missing, follow the instructions on Black Forest Labs original post.
Should work I think. Make some issues if it doesn't. Hope this saves you guys some effort!
